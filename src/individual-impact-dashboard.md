# Individual Consumption Behaviors

Understanding individual consumption behaviors is essential for interpreting how Americans spend, save, and allocate financial resources across different categories and regions. Although national spending trends often appear abstract, visualizing consumption patterns over time and across states reveals meaningful insights about economic growth, income disparities, and shifting household priorities. The following dashboards provide a detailed examination of consumer expenditure trends in the United States, highlighting long-term national growth, comparing state-level spending and income relationships, and mapping how consumption has changed geographically from 1997 to 2019.

## Visualization: U.S. Consumer Spending Patterns, 1997–2019

## Analysis

### 1. Annual Consumer Expenditures in the U.S.

This line chart displays national annual consumer expenditures across multiple spending categories from 1997 to 2019. Almost every category shows steady upward growth, reflecting both inflation and increased consumption over time. Durable goods and financial services stand out as the categories with the most significant increases, indicating rising consumer investment in goods with longer lifespans and expanding financial sector activity. The consistent upward trajectory suggests that American consumption has grown substantially over the past two decades, with little evidence of long-term decline even through economic disruptions such as the 2008 recession.

### 2. 2019 Personal Consumption Expenditure per Person vs. Income per Person by U.S. State

This scatterplot compares average annual spending per person to average annual income per person for each state in 2019. The strong positive trend line indicates that states with higher incomes also tend to have higher consumer spending. However, the slope reveals that spending does not increase at the same rate as income, suggesting diminishing marginal propensity to consume as income rises. Outliers help illustrate regional economic differences: some states spend a disproportionately high share relative to income, while wealthier states tend to save or invest a larger portion of earnings. Overall, the plot highlights how closely linked income and consumption are, while still allowing space for cultural, geographic, and cost-of-living variations.

### 3. Percent Growth in Consumer Expenditures by State, 1997–2019

The choropleth map visualizes how consumer spending has grown across states over the 22-year period. States in the West and South generally show the highest growth rates, reflecting rapid population increases, expanding job markets, and rising costs of living. Meanwhile, several states in the Midwest and Northeast exhibit more moderate growth, aligning with slower demographic expansion and more stable long-term economic conditions. The regional variation in consumption growth underscores how economic development, migration patterns, and industry composition shape household spending behavior differently across the country.
